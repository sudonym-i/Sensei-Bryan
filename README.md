# Deployed

**MAIN GOAL - makes you think rather than answer everything and turning your brain off**

decide what key features we want to build (all propositions)
    asking questions, etc
    finding sources
    generating rewarding, gamefied, study strategies




#  Brainstorming ideas

**1 - teaching mode**

1.2 - start by asking what subject ( what level; college, high school, baby)
   ex: string var = college algebra; + conext "explain X + **at a college level**"

1.3 - ask their main question

1.4 - overview, example of solving question, and then finish with a practice question

1.5 - evaluate answer, and point out correct/incorrect parts of response
**1.5.2 - use fact checking for AI answers + maybe diversify sources to ensure correct answers**


**2 - flashcards**

**3 - practice test feature**

**4 - diagrams (more advenced, future stuff) (would search for images rather than generating)**

# Funding

As running this web app isnt free (primarily because of LLM per-M-token costs), we need to find a way to fund this project
IDEAS
1 - Crowd fund. Have a big fund that anyone can donate to, which goes directly into a pooled openrouter api key, loading funds which pay for everyones LLM usage
